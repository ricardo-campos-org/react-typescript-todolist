## 📝 About the Project

TaskNote was firstly created to meet my personal needs of having a simple tool to manage tasks and notes. Clean and minimal. However after a couple of weeks I was assigned a challenge to finish within one month a set of tasks, technical tasks, that I decided to put it practice here, at this project. At the end of that month, I got most the app ready.

Then I decided keep going, found a host and a name. And that's it. Here we are!
